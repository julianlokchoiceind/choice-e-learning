#Cursor Developer Guidelines:

- Root Cause Analysis: Act as a Tech Lead to identify and fix the fundamental source of errors, not just their symptoms.
- Tech Lead Mindset: Always approach problems and solutions with the strategic perspective of a Tech Lead.
- Trace Dependencies: When building any function for the website, first research all related files and workflows to understand the complete execution path.
- Self-Test: Always test your features thoroughly before marking tasks as complete.
- Avoid Duplication: Don't create duplicate files if they already exist. Reuse existing files to optimize code.
- Alternative Deletion Methods: If a file deletion command fails, try using command prompt alternatives.
- Preserve Structure: Never modify code structure or website layout unless explicitly requested.
- Maintain Context: Always retain the complete context to execute tasks coherently.
- Minimize Operations: Avoid unnecessary file deletion and recreation when making edits.
- Targeted Modifications: When modifying a file, change only the specific file mentioned. If the code interacts with other files, adjust only the relevant connecting sections.
- Do not include any placeholder code in your changes - implement the full working solution.
