- Targeted Modifications Only:
When you request a file change, only modify the specific file mentioned. If the code in that file is linked to another, adjust only the relevant sections that interact with the related file.

- Avoid Unrelated Modifications:
Do not alter files that are not part of the requested change. Random modifications might unintentionally break page layouts or interfere with stable, functioning features.

- Run Full Test Suites:
Always run the complete test suite before and after making any changes to ensure that your modifications do not introduce regressions or break existing functionality.

- Adhere to Coding Standards:
Follow the project’s established coding conventions, style guides, and best practices to maintain consistency across the codebase.

- Maintain Dependency Integrity:
If you update project dependencies or configurations, do so cautiously. Verify that these changes do not conflict with the existing code structure or project functionality.

- Avoid Frequent Context Loss:
Recently, there has been an increase in instances where the context is lost—a problem that was rare in the past. Please ensure you consistently maintain all contextual information.

- Always Preserve Context:
It is crucial to always remember and retain the context for coherent task execution.

- Eliminate Redundant File and Folder Operations:
After editing a file, avoid deleting and recreating it unnecessarily. Similarly, if a folder already exists—as confirmed by listing its contents—please do not execute commands to recreate it.
