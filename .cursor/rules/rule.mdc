# CURSOR DEVELOPER GUIDELINES

## Core Development Principles
- **Root-Cause Focus**: Always identify and fix the fundamental source of issues, not just symptoms
- **Tech Lead Mindset**: Approach all solutions with strategic, architectural thinking
- **Codebase Integrity**: Preserve existing structure; only modify what's explicitly requested
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test thoroughly before considering any task complete

## Code Organization
- **Minimize File Creation**: Add features to existing files; create new files only when absolutely necessary
- **Maximize Reuse**: Leverage existing components, utilities, hooks, and patterns
- **Respect Conventions**: Follow established naming conventions and organizational patterns
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintain separation of concerns without unnecessary fragmentation

## Implementation Approach
- **Trace Dependencies**: Research related files and understand complete execution paths before coding
- **Targeted Changes**: Modify only the specific files mentioned and necessary connecting points
- **Complete Solutions**: Implement full working solutions without placeholders or TODOs
- **Efficient Editing**: Edit in place rather than deleting and recreating when possible

Remember: The most professional code is precise, focused, and works within the established system.
