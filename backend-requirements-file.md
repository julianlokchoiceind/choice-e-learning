2. **Course Listing Page:** Grid layout with search and filtering capabilities
3. **Challenges Page:** Coding exercises and community challenges
4. **Reviews Page:** User testimonials and feedback
5. **FAQ Page:** Frequently asked questions with expandable sections
6. **Roadmap Page:** Learning path visualization
7. **Course Detail Page:** Comprehensive course information including:
   - Course banner and description
   - Instructor information
   - Lesson list and curriculum
   - Student reviews
8. **Login/Signup Page:** Authentication with multiple options
9. **User Dashboard:** Track progress and manage account
10. **Admin Dashboard:** Manage platform content and users

### Frontend Technical Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js with App Router
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React Query for server state, Context API/Zustand for client state
- **UI Components:** Custom components with Framer Motion animations
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach

## Backend Requirements

### Database Structure
**MongoDB Atlas** (cloud-hosted MongoDB) with Prisma ORM will be used for all data storage needs.

### MongoDB Atlas Integration
- Cloud-based database deployment
- Automatic scaling and backups
- Database monitoring and alerts
- Connection string management via environment variables
- Secure network access configuration

### Core Backend Components

#### 1. Database Models
- **User Model:** Authentication, profile, and role management
- **Course Model:** Course content, metadata, and relationships
- **Challenge Model:** Interactive coding exercises
- **Review Model:** User feedback and ratings
- **FAQ Model:** Platform documentation
- **Roadmap Model:** Learning path information

#### 2. API Routes Implementation
- Authentication endpoints
- Course management endpoints
- User progress tracking
- Challenge submission and evaluation
- Review submission and display
- Administrative functions

#### 3. Authentication System
- NextAuth.js integration
- Email/password authentication
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- Role-based access control

### Backend Technical Stack
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 or similar cloud storage
- **API Architecture:** RESTful endpoints in Next.js API routes

## Backend Structure
